Today I learned how to build stacking cards, practiced gestures, and learned some cool array tricks.

## Code

## Cool Array tricks.

This will auto create an array of 10 cards.

```swift
    @State private var cards = Array<Card>(repeating: Card.example, count: 10)

```

## Gesture

- The gesture controls the offset and will reset if offset is less than 100 if it's greater than 100 it will make the card disappear
- The gesture controls the opacitity and rotation effect the opacitity because we are minus 2 will not start to take effect until the user moves 100 pixels.

## Stacking Cards

This uses a cool extension to offset the card based on the position it is in the stack.  We use withAnimation so that dynamically recalculates the stack.

```swift
extension View {
    func stacked(at position: Int, in total: Int) -> some View {
        let offset = Double(total - position)
        return self.offset(x: 0, y: offset * 10)
    }
}
```
