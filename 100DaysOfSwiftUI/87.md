## Timers

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    // tolerance is the amount of the the timer fire within
    // every is number seconds will fire
    // main is the main thread
    // common is the loop that that it's running on
    // auto connect will fire timer immediately
    let timer = Timer.publish(every: 1, tolerance: 0.5, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()
    
    @State private var counter = 0
    

    var body: some View {
        
        Text("Hello World")
            .padding()
            // allows swiftui to listen to timer broadcasts
            .onReceive(timer) { time in
                
                if counter == 5 {
                // Cancels the timers
                    timer.upstream.connect().cancel()
                } else {
                    print("The time is now \(time)")

                }
                counter += 1
            }
    }
}
```

## ScenePhase

- Tells swift when app transitions
- Active means the user and interact with the app
- InActive means the still foreground but is not interacting with the app all
- Background means the app the is no longer visible or being used

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @Environment(\.scenePhase) var scenePhase

    var body: some View {
        
        Text("Hello World")
            .padding()
            .onChange(of: scenePhase) { newPhase in
                if newPhase == .active {
                    print("ACTIVE")
                } else if newPhase == .inactive {
                    print("INACTIVE")
                } else if newPhase == .background {
                    print("Background")
                }
            }
    }
}

```
