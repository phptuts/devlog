## Timers

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    // tolerance is the amount of the the timer fire within
    // every is number seconds will fire
    // main is the main thread
    // common is the loop that that it's running on
    // auto connect will fire timer immediately
    let timer = Timer.publish(every: 1, tolerance: 0.5, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()
    
    @State private var counter = 0
    

    var body: some View {
        
        Text("Hello World")
            .padding()
            .onReceive(timer) { time in
                
                if counter == 5 {
                // Cancels the timers
                    timer.upstream.connect().cancel()
                } else {
                    print("The time is now \(time)")

                }
                counter += 1
            }
    }
}
```
