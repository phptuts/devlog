# Day 87 of 100DaysOfSwiftUI - 2022-09-24

Today I learned how to use timers, know when my apps go from active to the background, and use environment variables to access accessibility properties.

## Timers

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    // tolerance is the amount of the the timer fire within
    // every is number seconds will fire
    // main is the main thread
    // common is the loop that that it's running on
    // auto connect will fire timer immediately
    let timer = Timer.publish(every: 1, tolerance: 0.5, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()
    
    @State private var counter = 0
    

    var body: some View {
        
        Text("Hello World")
            .padding()
            // allows swiftui to listen to timer broadcasts
            .onReceive(timer) { time in
                
                if counter == 5 {
                // Cancels the timers
                    timer.upstream.connect().cancel()
                } else {
                    print("The time is now \(time)")

                }
                counter += 1
            }
    }
}
```

## ScenePhase App Going from Inview to Background

- Tells swift when app transitions
- Active means the user and interact with the app
- InActive means the still foreground but is not interacting with the app all
- Background means the app the is no longer visible or being used

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @Environment(\.scenePhase) var scenePhase

    var body: some View {
        
        Text("Hello World")
            .padding()
            .onChange(of: scenePhase) { newPhase in
                if newPhase == .active {
                    print("ACTIVE")
                } else if newPhase == .inactive {
                    print("INACTIVE")
                } else if newPhase == .background {
                    print("Background")
                }
            }
    }
}

```

## Accessibility Environemnt

-  You can use environment variables to customize app accessiblity behaviors

```swift
func withOptionalAnimation<Result> (_ animation: Animation? = .default, _ body: () throws -> Result) rethrows -> Result {
    if UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled {
        return try body()
    } else {
        return try withAnimation(animation, body)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion
    @State private var scale = 1.0
    
    var body: some View {
            Text("Hello, world")
            .scaleEffect(scale)
            .onTapGesture {
                
                    withOptionalAnimation {
                        scale *= 1.5
                    }
                }
    }
}
```
